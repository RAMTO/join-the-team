## The interview process
We do a initial screening, followed by a task and technical interview. You can read more about this in [our guide](interview-process.md) or just email us at [jobs@jiminny.com](mailto:jobs@jiminny.com) to get things started.

For all candidates, we ask you to complete a short take-home task. We think that this is a more fair and effective way to understand your skills, as compared to an in-person whiteboard interview.

To help set expectations, we believe this should take under 3-4 hours to complete. We understand that you have other responsibilities, so if you think you’ll need more than a week, just let us know when you expect to send a reply. You can ask as many questions as you like.

On our end, we’ll commit to getting back to you in 2-3 business days.
