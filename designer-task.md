# Jiminny Design Take Home Project

For product design candidates, we kick off the interview process with a few questions via email. This is actually for two reasons:

1. We’d like to see the first draft of how you’d solve for a complex UI.
2. Even more, it’ll give us a chance to see how we all interact and discuss work as a group when it comes to design process.

The ‘deliverable’ here is a collection of wireframes that outline how the user accomplishes a task. To set expectations, we think this should take under 3-4 hours.

Spec coming soon!
